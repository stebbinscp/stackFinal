# stackFinal
Local:
Start mongo on local machine with: docker run -it --rm -p 27017:27017 mongo
Start quarkus on local machine by navigating to maven, movies-quarkus, plug-ins, quarkus, quarkus:dev
Start vaadinNetflix by using the green triangle

Remote:
Remotely, the lightsail is already operating the mongo db and quarkus, so the only work that needs to be done
is to locally deploy the vaadinNetflix as instructed above

For both, the aws email contact is already deployed on AWS.
